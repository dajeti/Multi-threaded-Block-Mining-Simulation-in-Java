# Multi-threaded-Block-Mining-Simulation-in-Java
This project is a Java-based multi-threaded simulation of blockchain block mining. It illustrates essential blockchain concepts such as proof-of-work, hashing, and concurrency. Blocks are mined concurrently using multiple threads to efficiently achieve a specified difficulty level.
